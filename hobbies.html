        <p>My two primary hobbies consist of playing football and playing video games. I had started playing football in the 6th grade and have played it until now, when I am in my senior year in highschool. I feel like the sport teaches you discipline and
          can often teach you how to work. It helps develop a strong work ethic as well as helps you learn how to participate in a team based activity and it also teaches you how to communicate.</p>
